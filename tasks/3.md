# Task 3. Deque

Implement a deque (double-ended queue) in two ways:

- using two stacks (use normal Lisp lists and `push`/`pop` operations on them)
- by defining a structure `deque-node` and a superstrucutre `deque` that will have `head` and `tail` pointers to these nodes

Also, write the function to compare these two implementations in terms of runtime. This function should generate a number of random sequences of deque operations, like this:

```
push 1
shift 2
shift 3
unshift
pop
push 4
push 5
unshift
pop
...
```

and then apply them to both deque variants and report the statistics after a significant number of runs.
